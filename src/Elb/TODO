Mario
1. remove annoying comments from code (move to separate branch)
2. implement RandInt in non-master branch
3. start documenting Jacob's code
4. reread large TODO example in annoying branch

Jacob
1. Implement Dirichlet, language models

System
Jacob writes shit tons of code, Mario documents so he understands until both
are similarly productive (or Mario is at least really fucking productive).
